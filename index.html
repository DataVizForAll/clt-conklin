          <h2>Introduction: What are Community Land Trusts</h2>

         
          <p><a href="https://shelterforce.org/2021/07/12/understanding-community-land-trusts/">Community land trusts </a> (CLTs) are non-profit organizations that set out to provide affordability to the community that it serves. These organizations acquire and oversee land which they lease to the community, outside of market pressures. This means that CLTs can be leveraged in different ways. Communities may use land to provide access to affordable farming, small businesses, rental housing, and homeownership. These land trusts can take various forms, however, they are seen predominately being utilized to provide affordable housing. The typical CLT model operates by the nonprofit owning the grounds of the land and allowing individuals to purchase the structure that sits on the land at a below-market price, separating the ownership of the land and building. By purchasing a home through community land trusts, the homeowners will get a 99-year renewable and inheritable lease on the land, that functions to replicate the traditional homeowner model. By agreeing to purchase the home at an affordable price, the homeowner also must adhere to the resale stipulations, a calculated formula that keeps the home affordable for the next buyer but also allows the former owner to gain some equity. CLTs have been important in establishing ownership affordability and continues to be incorporated across communities.
</p>

          <p><a href="https://cljct.org/about-us/our-mission-and-history/"> The Center for Leadership and Justice</a> is a non-profit organization working to address social injustices within the community. This organization first began in 1850 to respond to the challenges faced by poor and immigrant individuals in the Hartford area. CLJ has continued its legacy of activism and advocacy through the creation of a number of programs and initiatives that strive to empower community members. Under the Center for Leadership and Justice, the <a href="https://cljct.org/what-we-do/housing-initiatives/">Urban Suburban Affordables (USA) </a> program started. This is one of Connecticut’s community land trusts that was first launched in the 1990s and began as a collaboration with the Connecticut Department of Housing. Its primary goal is to obtain land and provide low and moderate-income families with affordable homeownership opportunities in Hartford and its surrounding suburbs. Today, the USA program encompasses over 211 properties in the Hartford metropolitan area, contributing to the efforts to increase homeownership. This data story will examine the prevalence of the USA properties across Connecticut and compare this program to other community land trust organizations to understand the success of USA homes.

          <h2>USA Properties: A Breakdown of Where Homes are Located</h2>

          <p class="lead">The table below shows the breakdown of where USA homes are located and the type of house in each of the towns.</p>

          <p>There are 211 USA properties. Out of the 211 homes, only 25 are multi-family homes, and the remaining are single-family homes, which account for 186 of the properties. Hartford has the largest numbers of single-family and multi-family homes making it the town with the largest amount of USA properties. It has a total of 94 USA properties in the city, which is almost three times more than East Hartford, the town with the second-largest share of USA homes. Following East Hartford, towns such as Bloomfield, West Hartford, and Windsor show the most significant stock of USA homes. </p>

           <p>The properties are clustered within central Connecticut. More specifically all but one USA home in Meriden is located in the Capitol Planning Region. Since the map is not zoomable in order to protect the privacy of residents who take part in the USA program, it makes it difficult to see more detailed patterns of the location of properties. In the map below, by focusing on the five towns with the greatest number of USA homes, the spatial trends of the homes become more apparent.</p>

          <p>The map below shows the five Connecticut towns with the greatest number of USA properties: Hartford, East Hartford, Bloomfield, West Hartford, and Windsor. In Hartford, there is a lack of USA homes in the central part of the city as well as on the east border of Hartford. However, there is a large clustering happening in the northwest and southwest corners of Hartford's boundaries. In East Hartford, the properties tend to be a little more spread across the town, there is a small amount of clustering happening in the northern part of the town, but overall the properties seem to scatter across the area. In Bloomfield, there are two main groupings, one is located on the border that neighbors Windsor, and the second is north on the border shared with Hartford. West Hartford's USA property clustering appears mainly on the east side of the town, next to the border with Hartford, and shows no properties located on the west. Finally, Windsor's USA home groupings appear to be in the northern part of the town. The towns surrounding Hartford, show a clustering near the city's boundary, with the exception of East Hartford, whose properties show a more spread-out pattern.  </p>

          <h2>Comparing CLTs: The difference between USA Homes and Other Community Land Trusts</h2>

<p class="lead">Comparing the size of CLTs is more difficult than at first glance. </p>

         <p> The measurement of affordable housing stock is inconsistent between community land trusts. Some community land trusts use the number of housing units to tell a story about the size of their program, while other CLTs choose to provide information on the number of properties. A housing unit is a living space that can be occupied by a household, which means that in a rental apartment, there are multiple units available, and within a single-family house only one unit is available. Properties are defined as the structure that sits on the land, there could be many units within a structure, but a property is measured just by the building itself. These differences across CLTs can lead to varied interpretations of the data.  </p> 

          <p>The Urban Suburban Affordables program is ranked the highest for homeownership properties in the region and ranked third in housing units. The table shows the three largest CLTs in the region based on housing units. The USA program has 211 properties within its program that are designated for purchasing, these are all properties that offer homeownership to its community. The 239 units represent the amount of households that can occupy the 211 properties. For CLT A, it comes in first for housing units with 687 units available and CLT B comes in 2nd for housing units. CLTs A and B do not offer specific data about how many homeownership properties they have. This means that the units could be homeownership units or rental apartment units.  </p>
          
           <iframe title="USA Ranks First Homeownership Properties in the Region and 3rd For Housing Units " aria-label="Table" id="datawrapper-chart-2jlOI" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/2jlOI/3/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="294" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var t in a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<e.length;r++)if(e[r].contentWindow===a.source){var i=a.data["datawrapper-height"][t]+"px";e[r].style.height=i}}}))}();
</script>    

          <p> Some CLTs do a better job at providing affordable units and some CLTs do better at providing affordable homeownership properties. This means different outcomes in terms of who is using these programs. CLTs with more homeownership properties available allow the user to create equity from their purchase. Having a large number of affordable units within the program means that it may provide affordable housing for households that rent or purchase a unit.  </p>

  <p></p>   

          <p>This map below shows the number of housing units within community land trusts in Connecticut and Massachusetts. A housing unit is a living space that is occupied by a household, rental apartments and homeowner units are both incorporated in this calculation. Using data from community land trust directories, the map shows that the Urban Suburban Affordables program has the third largest number of housing units in the region. If you use the interactive chart to hover over each bubble, the map will show data about each CLTs housing unit and homeownership units. Out of all of the CLTs that provided information about homeownership units, the Urban Suburban Affordables Program had the greatest amount of units out of both states.</p>

          <h2>Methods and Sources</h2>

          <p>The data used throughout this web page came from Urban Suburban Affordables, Inc. This information provided the Trinity College Dataviz class with information about the addresses of USA properties within Connecticut. From this data set, Dataviz instructor, Jack Dougherty, cleaned up the data with his students by adding property assessor data and Zillow data columns. This spreadsheet mainly guided the second part of this project which was the "USA Properties: A Breakdown of Where USA Homes are Located" section. By inputting the coordinates of the USA homes into Datawrapper's symbol point map, the information created the final product of images 3 and 4.</p>

            <p>For the section that compared the USA program to other CLTs, I used websites given to me by Jack Dougherty, which included different community land trust directories. I used two different directories to make sure that if there was missing information on one website I could use the other resource to collect data on other CLTs. After compiling a list of CLTs in Massachusetts and Connecticut, I went through each website to collect information on the amount of affordable units each CLT had. Since each organization has a different way of presenting its data, it was difficult to distinguish rental units from ownership units. In image 4, the bubbles show rental and ownership units combined in order to create uniformity within data measurement, because a lot of CLT pages did not specify which ones were ownership units it was difficult to draw comparisons on the size of the program. </p>
